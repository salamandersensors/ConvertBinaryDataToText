Here is the binary to hexadecimal converter bin_hex2.txt.  The program expects two
command line arguments; the first is the name of the file to read the binary
from and the second is the one where the final formatted hexadecimal is
stored.  So      perl bin_hex2.txt LOG17.bin LOG17.txt     would
convert LOG17.bin into hexadecimal and store the results in LOG17.txt.  Two
files that I used in debugging (hex.txt and temp.txt) are created when the
program is run, but these aren't important and can be deleted.
